# Currency Converter App

It is a currency converter application made using:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. A bit of jQuery
5. APIs (Exchange Rate and Flagcdn)

## How to Use

1. Enter the Amount
2. Select Currencies
3. Click Convert

It works just like most existing currency converter.

### Prerequisites
Just run it in your browser and make sure that you have internet connection because it is APIs dependent.

## Disclaimer
The design is originally made by me, but the logic behind it is base from "YT:CodingNepal".
